# DiplomaThesis-PythonWord2Vec
My thesis' Text Statistical analysis using Google's pre-trained Word2Vec model to map the texts by their total semantic meaning.

This space will change a lot:
Firstly, the Python implementation of Word2Vec is going to be uploaded
Then, the C scripts that run the Word2Vec on embedded systems
and lastly, some examples and results on how-to use all these.

Excuse me, I am graduating and I don't have the time to fix all that just yet!
